<b>
The problem.
</b>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle">8-puzzle problem</a>
is a puzzle popularized by Sam Loyd in the 1870s. It is 
played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank 
square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. 
You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically
into the blank square. 
The following 
shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board position (left)
to the goal position (right).
</p><pre><blockquote>
    1  3        1     3        1  2  3        1  2  3        1  2  3
 4  2  5   =&gt;   4  2  5   =&gt;   4     5   =&gt;   4  5      =&gt;   4  5  6
 7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8  6        7  8 

 initial                                                      goal</blockquote></pre>

<p>
<b>Best-first search.</b>
We now describe a solution to the problem that illustrates a 
general artificial intelligence methodology known as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>.
We define a <em>state</em> of the game to be the board position, the number
of moves made to reach there, and the previous state.
First, insert the initial state 
(the initial board, 0 moves, and a null previous state) 
into a priority queue. Then,
delete from the priority queue the state with the minimum priority,
and insert onto the priority queue all neighboring states
(those that can be reached in one move).
Repeat this procedure until the state dequeued is the goal state.
The success of this approach
hinges on the choice of <em>priority function</em>.

</p><ul>

<li><em>Hamming priority function.</em>
A natural priority function for a given state is the number
of blocks in the wrong position,
plus the number of moves made so far to get to the state.
Intutively, states with a small number of blocks in the wrong position
are close to the goal state, and we prefer states that
have been reached using a small number of moves.

<p></p></li><li><em>Manhattan priority function.</em>
A better priority function for a given state is the
sum of the distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance)
from the blocks to their goal positions,
plus the number of moves made so far to get to the state.

</li></ul>

For example, the Hamming and Manhattan priorities of the state below
are 5 and 10, respectively.

<pre><blockquote>
 8  1  3        1  2  3     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
 4     2        4  5  6     ----------------------    ----------------------
 7  6  5        7  8        1  1  0  0  1  1  0  1    1  2  0  0  2  2  0  3

 initial          goal           Hamming = 5              Manhattan = 10</blockquote></pre>


<p>
We make a key oberservation: to solve the puzzle from
a given state on the priority queue, the total number of moves we
need to make (including those already made) is at least its priority,
using either the Hamming or Manhattan priority function.
(For Hamming priority, this is true because each block out of place
must move at least once to reach its goal position.
For Manhattan priority, this is true because each block must move
its Manhattan distance from its goal position.
Note that we do not count the blank tile when computing the
Hamming or Manhattan priorities.)

</p><p>
Consequently, as soon as we dequeue a state,
we have not only discovered a sequence of moves from the
initial board to the board associated with the state, but 
one that makes the fewest number of moves. 
(Challenge for the mathematically inclined: prove this fact.)

</p><p><b>A useful optimization.</b>
After implementing this procedure, you will notice one annoying
feature: states corresponding to the same board position 
are enqueued on the priority queue many times.
To prevent unnecessary exploration of useless states,
when considering the neighbors of a state, don't enqueue
the neighbor if its board position is the same as the
previous state.

</p><pre><blockquote>
 8  1  3      8  1  3     8  1  3
 4     2      4  2        4     2
 7  6  5      7  6  5     7  6  5

 previous      state      disallow</blockquote></pre>

<p><b>Your task.</b>
Write a program <tt>Solver.java</tt> that reads the initial board
from standard input and prints to standard output a sequence of
board positions that solves the puzzle in the fewest number of moves.
Also print out the total number
of moves and the <font color="green">total</font> number of states 
<font color="green">ever</font> enqueued.
The input will consist of the board dimension <em>N</em> followed by
the <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em>
initial board position. The input format uses 0 to represent
the blank square. As an example,

</p><pre><blockquote><b>% more puzzle04.txt</b>
3
 0  1  3
 4  2  5
 7  8  6

% <b>java Solver &lt; puzzle04.txt</b>
    1  3 
 4  2  5 
 7  8  6 

 1     3 
 4  2  5 
 7  8  6 

 1  2  3 
 4     5 
 7  8  6 

 1  2  3 
 4  5   
 7  8  6 

 1  2  3 
 4  5  6 
 7  8   

Number of moves = 4
Number of states enqueued = 11</blockquote></pre>

Note that your program should work for arbitrary <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> boards
(for any <em>N</em> greater than 1), even if it is too slow to solve them.



<p><b>Detecting infeasible puzzles.</b>
Not all initial board positions can lead to the goal state.
Modify your program to detect and report such situations. 

</p><pre><blockquote>% <b>more puzzle-impossible3x3.txt</b>
3
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 8  7  0

% <b>java Solver &lt; puzzle3x3-impossible.txt</b>
No solution possible</blockquote></pre>

<em>Hint</em>: you may use the fact that board positions
are divided into two equivalence classes wirth repsect to reachability:
(i) those that lead to the goal position and (ii) those that
lead to the goal position if we modify the initial board by
swapping any pair of adjacent (non-blank) blocks.
There are two ways to apply the hint:

<ul>

<li> Run the A* algorithm simultaneously on two puzzle instances - one with the
initial board and one with the initial board modified by
swapping a pair of adjacent (non-blank) blocks. Exactly one of
the two will lead to the goal position.

<p></p></li><li> Derive a mathematical formula that tells you whether a board is 
solvable or not.

</li></ul>



<p><b>Deliverables.</b>
Organize your program in an appropriate number of data types.
At a minimum, you are required to implement the following APIs.
Though, you are free to add additional methods or data types (such as <tt>State</tt>).

</p><p>


</p><blockquote><pre>public class Board {
   public Board(int[][] tiles)        // construct a board from an N-by-N array of tiles
   public int hamming()               // return number of blocks out of place
   public int manhattan()             // return sum of Manhattan distances between blocks and goal
   public boolean equals(Object y)    // does this board equal y
   public Iterable&lt;Board&gt; neighbors() // return an Iterable of all neighboring board positions
   public String toString()           // return a string representation of the board
}


public class Solver {
   public Solver(Board initial)   // find a solution to the initial board
   public boolean isSolvable()    // is the initial board solvable?
   public int moves()             // return min number of moves to solve the initial board
                                  <font color="green">// -1 if no such solution</font>
   public void showSolution()     // display the solution (as described above)

   //  read puzzle instance from stdin and print solution to stdout, as above
   public static void main(String[] args)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Submit <tt>Board.java</tt>, <tt>Solver.java</tt>
<font color="green">(with the Manhattan priority)</font>
and any other helper data types
that you use besides those included in <tt>stdlib.jar</tt> and <tt>adt.jar</tt>.
